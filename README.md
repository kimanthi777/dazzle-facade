## A SaaS [HR]
A WAI-ARIA compliant HR system

B2B Platform: An organization wants to outsource a robust system that will adapt to thier demands. Super Admin creates an account<HR>.

He will be responsible for:
- Handling billing, reciepts, deleting other accounts, and onboarding etc
- Give other users permissions

### Goal
Merge everything I've learnt over the years on open source, internal school competitive programming, technical writing, and generally twinkling around with tools. The goal is to build a complete end-to-end personal project with a custom design system, implements typescript, incremental best practices.

### Code Conventions
- I'm using a custom extension [Better comments] to add syntax highlighting on my comments @VS Code.
- Where possible, single quotes on strings over double quotes
- Where possible, normal functions over arrow functions


## Tech Stack
- CloudRun -> Cost effective
- Nestjs -> (Monolith)TypeScript gives Typesafe APIs [REST/ HTTP/2]
- MongoDB & Postgres
- Redis Caching layer
- MeiliSearch: indexing and querying data [instant filter, sorts, etc]
- Docker
- GitHub actions [CI/CD] for CI pipelines

### Future recommendations
- Verify and store employee certificates within the system i.e *sign documents and more*: _A blockchain storage and solution? IPFS or verify with AI befor pushing into a blockchain storage??_
- Startups often need to go through processes such as funding and legal requirements while still hiring to roll product. Adding this will shift the software from just a HR solution to a fully fledged product that cuts across multiple organization needs:

If you find pride in your craft, it is tempting to pursue cleanliness in code. Do it for a while. But don't stop there. Don't be a clean code zealot. Clean code is not a goal. It's an attempt to make some sense out of the immense complexity of systems we're dealing with. Let clean code guide you. Then let it go.

UI is a composition of components (Angular, React, etc), with composite and leaf components. Similarly, in the file system we have directories and files. Since the component tree and the file system have the same structure we can apply the same algorithms on top of them.
